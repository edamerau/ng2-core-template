# Ng2CoreTemplate

NG2CoreTemplate provides a fully responsive core-template for angular2 projects.
The projects `node-modules` include:

- a stable `Bootstrap3` version for ui-elements, media-query driven ui-components and icons (glyphicons)
- `angular-cli` for a bunch of console-commands which make your work way easier
- `Primefaces` a.k.a. `PrimeNG` as an alternative and/or extension of `Bootstrap3`(feel free to choose or combine them in your code) Note: `PrimeNG` also provides charts, panels and other stuff
- `ng-build` to quickly build your project (`.ts` to `.js`)

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.24.

## Basic Commands 
- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. 
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

- Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. 
You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

- Run `ng build` to build the project. 
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 
Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

- Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

- Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
