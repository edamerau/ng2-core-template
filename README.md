# Ng2CoreTemplate

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.24.
It provides a fully responsive core-template for angular2 projects.
The projects `node-modules` provide:

- a stable `Bootstrap3` version to use for ui-elements, media-query driven components and icons (glyphicons)
- `angular-cli` for any console-commands 
- `ngprime` as an alternative or extension of `Bootstrap3`(feel free to choose) which also provides charts, panels and other stuff

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. 
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. 
You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 
Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

## Running end-to-end tests
