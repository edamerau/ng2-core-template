# Ng2CoreTemplate

NG2CoreTemplate provides a fully responsive core-template for angular2 projects.
The projects `node-modules` include:

- a stable `Bootstrap3` version for ui-elements, media-query driven ui-components and icons (glyphicons)
- `angular-cli` for a bunch of console-commands which make your work way easier
- `Primefaces` a.k.a. `PrimeNG` as an alternative and/or extension of `Bootstrap3`(feel free to choose or combine them in your code) Note: `PrimeNG` also provides charts, panels and other stuff

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.24.
